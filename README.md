# HIFAR Drive - A User-Friendly Integrated Visual Perception Pipeline for Autonomous Driving Systems

This repository presents a modular and interactive pipeline that integrates multiple computer vision techniques—depth estimation, optical flow, segmentation, object detection, and pose estimation—into a unified 3D visualization framework. The goal is to enable intuitive scene understanding for autonomous navigation.
