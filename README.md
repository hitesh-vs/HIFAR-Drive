# HIFAR Drive - A User-Friendly Integrated Visual Perception Pipeline for Autonomous Driving Systems

This repository presents a modular and interactive pipeline that integrates multiple computer vision techniquesâ€”depth estimation, optical flow, segmentation, object detection, and pose estimationâ€”into a unified 3D visualization framework. The goal is to enable intuitive scene understanding for autonomous navigation.


## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

-  **Depth Estimation** using monocular image inputs
-  **Optical Flow** for motion tracking between frames
-  **Color and Instance Segmentation** for identifying lane markings and road users
-  **Object Detection** with bounding box overlays
-  **Pose Estimation** for pedestrians
-  Unified pipeline with modular architecture and visual output renderer

This project has also been showcased in a [Product Pitch Video], highlighting the most notable features of the pipeline. The motive behind making this is to present the work as an engaging, product-oriented walkthrough that anyone can understand, ranging from laypersons to experts in the field.
